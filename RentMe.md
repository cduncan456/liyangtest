In this project, you will develop a furniture rental system for a store RentMe. The store has employees who rent furniture to customers. It provides member-only services to its customers, which means to be able to rent furniture, the customer must become a member first. An employee at the store may help the customer register. After successful registration, a customerâ€™s information (name, phone number, address, ssn, etc.) is kept in the DB and the customer is given a member ID number.
